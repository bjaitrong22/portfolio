  <h1>About me</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>my first web page</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I learned how to create a webpage using HTML and how to use css styles rules while working on this project. We also learned how to add an image to the our page. Here is the link to my <a href="my-first-webpage.html"> first web page</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>my garden blog using box-model</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I also used HTML and CSS for this class project, and I learned about the box model and how can I use it to create a more refined website by using margin, border, padding,and background color css styles rules. Here is the link to my <a href="garden-blog.html"> garden blog</a>.</li>
