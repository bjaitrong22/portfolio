  <h1>Hi! My name is Bai</h1>
    <p>I'm a part-time <strong>student at Epicodus</strong> learning how to program and here are few projects that I have worked on during class: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>my first web page</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I learned how to create a webpage using HTML and how to use css styles rules while working on this project. We also learned how to add an image to the our webpage. Here is the link to my <a href="https://github.com/bjaitrong22/my-first-webpage.html.git"> first web page</a> on GitHub repository.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>my garden blog using box-model</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I also used HTML and CSS for this class project, and I learned about the box model and how can I use it to create a more refined website by using margin, border, padding,and background color css styles rules. Here is the link to my <a href="https://github.com/bjaitrong22/my-first-webpage.html.git"> pet website</a> on GitHub repository.</li>
          </ul>
